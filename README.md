## Architecture

- Grey dashed               Backup and DR flows (Velero → MinIO → rclone → OneDrive)
- Blue dashed               GitOps reconciliation (GitHub → ArgoCD → cluster)
- Purple dashed             Webhook certificate provisioning and SSO authentication
- Red dashed                Secret injection (Vault → ESO → workloads)
- Green dashed              Metrics scraping and log shipping (Promtail → Loki)
- Green solid               Dashboard query flows (Grafana → Prometheus / Loki)

The diagram above illustrates the full platform architecture, deployed on a three-node kubeadm v1.31 cluster with Calico CNI. The platform is organised into six functional concern groups, all managed declaratively via GitOps.

### External Layer
- The platform engineer interacts with the cluster exclusively through Git — all changes are commits, never direct `kubectl apply`
- Code changes are pushed to GitHub as the single source of truth — ArgoCD reconciles the cluster state from there continuously
- Image promotion workflows are triggered manually via GitHub Actions, executed by ARC self-hosted runners running inside the cluster
- All external access is routed through **Cloudflare Tunnel**, providing secure ingress without any open inbound ports on the home network
- TLS is terminated at the Cloudflare edge — no inbound ports are exposed on the home network

### Networking · GitOps managed
- **ingress-nginx** routes all external traffic to internal services using host-based Ingress rules
- **cert-manager** manages TLS certificates for operator admission webhooks (CNPG, ESO) — TLS for external traffic is terminated at the Cloudflare edge
- **NetworkPolicies** enforce default-deny across every namespace — all inter-service communication is explicitly declared, preventing lateral movement between platform components and workloads

### CI/CD · GitOps managed
- **ARC (Actions Runner Controller)** runs self-hosted GitHub Actions runners inside the cluster in webhook-based scale-to-zero mode
- **ArgoCD** continuously reconciles cluster state against Git in poll mode (every 120s)
- The CI pipeline pulls upstream images from Docker Hub, scans them with Trivy, mirrors them to ghcr.io via crane, and commits the updated image tag to the Git values file — no custom images are built
- ArgoCD detects the tag change in Git and syncs the cluster automatically

### Workloads · GitOps managed
- **Nextcloud** is the primary platform workload, deployed for sovereign file sharing
- **CloudNativePG** manages the PostgreSQL database storing Nextcloud's metadata, user accounts, and application state
- **Longhorn** provides the replicated persistent volume (RF=2) for user file storage
- **Redis** handles session caching and file-locking to prevent write conflicts under concurrent access
- **Keycloak** provides SSO for Nextcloud via the `user_oidc` app, configured through the Nextcloud Admin UI
- Nextcloud was chosen as the reference workload because it exercises every platform layer simultaneously — storage, databases, identity, secrets, observability, backup, and networking

### Data · Storage · Backup · GitOps managed
- **Longhorn v1.7.2** (RF=2) is the default StorageClass, providing replicated block storage across worker nodes
- **CloudNativePG (CNPG)** manages PostgreSQL clusters, continuously archiving WAL to MinIO via Barman for point-in-time recovery
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible) is the central object store, backing Loki log storage, Velero backup snapshots, and CNPG WAL archives
- **Velero** backs up Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes via Kopia, storing snapshots in MinIO
- **rclone** runs as a nightly CronJob, syncing both MinIO buckets to OneDrive for an offsite DR copy — completing the 3-2-1 backup posture

### Security · Identity · GitOps managed
- **HashiCorp Vault** (KV v2) is the secrets backend, storing all platform secrets under component-namespaced paths
- **External Secrets Operator (ESO)** synchronises secrets from Vault into workloads, databases, and platform services as native Kubernetes Secret objects — no application reads from Vault directly
- **Keycloak 26** provides centralised OIDC identity for the platform, with SSO integrated across ArgoCD and Grafana via the homelab realm

### Observability · GitOps managed
- **Prometheus & Alertmanager** scrape metrics from all platform components and manage alerting rules
- **Grafana** visualises metrics from Prometheus and log data from Loki on unified dashboards
- **Loki** aggregates logs from across the cluster, backed by MinIO for durable log chunk storage
- **Promtail** runs as a DaemonSet on every node, collecting and shipping container and system logs to Loki

### Data Flow Summary

| Flow | Path |
|------|------|
| External traffic | Cloudflare → cloudflared → nginx-ingress → workloads |
| Secrets | Vault → ESO → Kubernetes Secrets → workloads · databases · platform services |
| User files | Workloads → Longhorn PVC |
| Database | CNPG (PostgreSQL) → WAL archiving → MinIO |
| Backup | Velero (Kopia) → MinIO · CNPG Barman → MinIO |
| Offsite DR | MinIO → rclone → OneDrive |
| Metrics | All components → Prometheus → Grafana |
| Logs | All nodes → Promtail → Loki (MinIO-backed) → Grafana |
